      <p><strong>Mills,</strong></p>
      <p>
        We're sorry to hear that you undergoing surgery, and hope that you
        recover soon. We thought about circulating a card to each and every
        person, and then delivering it last of all to you. And then we thought
        better of it. So here&rsquo;s a card to wish you well the way that only
        RRCHNM can make one.
      </p>
      <p>Best wishes,<br />The RRCHNM Team</p>

        Hope your knee is better and that you are back on the trail soon! Thanks
        for a great first year as director.
