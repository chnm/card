    <p><strong>Mills,</strong></p>
    <p>
      We're sorry to hear that you undergoing surgery, and hope that you
      recover soon. We thought about circulating a card to each and every
      person, and then delivering it last of all to you. And then we thought
      better of it. So here&rsquo;s a card to wish you well the way that only
      RRCHNM can make one.
    </p>
    <p>Best wishes,<br />The RRCHNM Team</p>

    <hr />
    <p>
      Mills,<br>
      Congrats on your first year as RRCHNM director. You've handled these extreme circumstances as well as possible
      and I'm confident that the Center is well positioned to handle the zombie attack and alien invasion that's surely
      coming in 2021.
      I hope your recovery goes smoothly. Since you always have a great joke or a story about Eastern Europe to share,
      I want to share my absolute favorite Eastern European under Communism joke:<br>
      Q: Why do the Czech People's Militia always travel in threes?<br>
      A: Because they need one to write the citation, one to read the citation, and one to keep an eye on the two
      dangerous intellectuals.
      <br>
      &mdash;Nate

    <p>Wishing you a speedy recovery, Mills! Thanks for your leadership and for the warm welcome to RRCHNM.

      Hi Mills, <br> I hope you're feeling better and recovering quickly. Lincoln asked us to bring up things from the
      early days of the online world. That's a bit before my memory so here is a [thread on
      Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3oyx1r/whats_your_earliest_memory_of_the_internet/) (which is
      from my time) about some early Internet memories. Thanks for your leadership over the past year. I look forward to
      the next one. <br> &mdash;Dan Howlett
    </p>
    <p>
      Brzké uzdravení! Hope you recover quickly! Thanks for all you do to make RRCHNM a great place to work and learn!

      for a great first year as director.
